A simple demonstration of the use of continuous queries in gemfire to notify a client of updates to stock prices for stocks that a user is interested in.  The stocks list is made up and so are the prices (i.e. not using a web service or anything).


. `cluster` contains a simple start script and configuration to start a locator and two servers locally:
+
----
cd cluster
./start.sh
----

. start the `Chart` app
+
----
gradle chartClient
----

. start the `FeedSimulator`
+
----
gradle feedSimulator
----

See the chart render prices for stocks as updates are made to prices in the region on the server.
